# Inbuilt Data Structures

> In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing , storing and managing data to perform operation efficiently.

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary

## List

> In Python , a list is an **ordered, mutable** collection of items, capable of storing elements of different data types.

**Characteristics**

* Ordered
* Mutable
* Heterogenous 
* Duplicates
* Dynamic
* Nested List

### Create a List

```python
L = list([1,2,3,4]) # Not Recommended
L = list(range(1,101))
```

### Accessing a List

```python
L = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
L[-1]
for e in L:
    print(e)
```

**Problem Statement**

Given a list [1,2,3,4,5,6,4,32,1,4,2,2]. Write a program to find how many time a given element exist in the list

```python
L = [1,2,3,4,5,6,4,32,1,4,2,2]
user_input = int(input("Enter a number to search times"))
count=0
for e in L:
    if e==2:
        count += 1
print(f"Total no of {user_input} is: {count}")

print(L.count(user_input))


def nu_search(L,num_to_search):
    count = 0
    for num in L:
        if num_to_search == num:
	        count+=1
    return count

L=[1,2,3,4,5,6,4,32,1,4,2,2]
print(nu_search(L,2))


num= int(input("Enter the number to Search For"))
coutnt=0
print("Count of",num,"in the List is :- ",nu_search(L,num))
```

## Tuple

> In Python , a tuple is an **ordered, immutable** collection of items, capable of storing elements of different data types.

**Creating a tuple**

```
T = (1,"Naveen Pn")
print(type(T))
```

**Accessing a tuple**

```
T[0]
T[1]
```

```python
for e in T:
  print(e)
```

## Dictionary

```
D ={"k1":["1","2"]}
D["k1"]

D.get("k1")
```
